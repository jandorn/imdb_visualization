# imdb_visualization

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a64cc692-deb8-41ee-908e-92fb194d8e47/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/imdbviz/deploys)

Codebase for a visualization of the IMDB dataset.

The webapp is deployed [here](https://imdbviz.com/).
On the deployed site, the loading percentage is not working properly (it works fine locally though). Rest assured, the data is still being loaded and computed. It just takes a couple of seconds.

## Project Setup

To setup the project locally:

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
